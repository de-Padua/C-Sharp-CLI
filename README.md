# C# CLI For NodeJS

## Description
This project is a simple C# console application that allows users to create a new project folder structure for Node.js Express applications. It provides a basic template for setting up an Express.js project with predefined files and dependencies.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Run the Application**: Compile and run the C# console application using your preferred development environment or command line.

3. **Follow the Prompts**: The application will prompt you to provide a name for your project and select the stack (language) for the project.

4. **Review Project Details**: Once you've provided the necessary information, the application will display the project name and stack you've chosen.

5. **Folder Creation**: The application will then create a folder for your project in the specified directory (`C:\\Users\\Ant√¥no\\Documents\\` by default) and open it in Visual Studio Code.

6. **Files and Dependencies**: Inside the project folder, the application will create the following files:
   - `package.json`: Contains the project configuration, including dependencies such as Express, Nodemon, and ESLint.
   - `index.js`: A basic Express.js application file with a simple route and server setup.

7. **Code and Customize**: Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code and start coding! You can customize the project files and add additional functionality as needed.

## Dependencies
- Node.js (for running Node.js applications)
- Visual Studio Code (for editing and running the project)
